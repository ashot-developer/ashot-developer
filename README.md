### Hey there

I am a Full Stack Web Developer with 2+ years of experience both in front-end and back-end development.
I really love my job and every challenge in the way of the working process, which motivates me to learn, grow and move forward.
At this moment I work and lead the ‚ÄúIT Training Center‚Äù of my own village. We aim to uplift the IT level in the village.
I move on with these guide ideas, dream, believe, do, repeat. And most of all NEVER GIVE UP.
